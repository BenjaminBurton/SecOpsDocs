# Documentation Intro

Let's discover **Network && Security Architecture && Concepts**.

## Getting Started

You should have basic understanding of **Networking && Security Concepts**.

Or **Have taken some classes** online or with **a Teacher or a Mentor**.

### What you'll need

- A laptop or Computer with Internet Access w/ a Basic Understanding of:
  - Multi-Cloud / Hybrid Infrastructure
  - Linux commands
  - SQL Database Queries
  - SaaS, PaaS, IaaS
  - IAM ( Identity Access Management )
  - TCP/IP Protocol
  - Physical && Logical Addressing
  - GRC ( Governance, Risk && Compliance )
  - IPv4 / IPv6 Networks
  - OSI Model (Packets, Frames, Encapsulation etc. )
  - BGP ( iBGP, iGRP )
  - Routing && Switching Protocols
  - Storage
  - SOC ( Security Operations Center )
  - SIEM ( Security information and event management )

### You Can Generate a Template Like This for your work

You can create a Documentation website for yourselves with this command below

- Using npx Package Manager

```bash
npx create-docusaurus@latest my-website classic
```

- Using yarn Package Manager

```bash
yarn create docusaurus
```

- You can Initialize the project with the command below

```bash
npm init docusaurus
```

You can type this command into the Command Prompt, Powershell, Terminal, or any other integrated terminal of your choice.

The command also installs all the necessary dependencies you need to run Docusaurus.

## Start your site

To Run the development server type the command below in your terminal:

```bash
cd my-website
yarn run start
or
npm run start
```

The `cd` command changes the directory you're working with. In order to work with your newly created Docusaurus site, you'll need to navigate the terminal there.

The `yarn run start` or `npm run start` command builds your website locally and serves it through a development server, ready for you to view at http://localhost:3000/.

Open `docs/intro.md` (this page) and edit some lines: the site **reloads automatically** and displays your changes.
